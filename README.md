# elf_loader

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](README_zh.md)  

A Rust library providing async loading interface to load and relocate ELF dynamic libraries from memory/files.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/elf_loader/)
# Capabilities
### âœ¨ Works in `no_std` environments âœ¨
This crate provides an elf loading interface which does not use any std
features, so it can be used in `no_std` environments such as kernels and embedded device.

### âœ¨ Fast speed âœ¨
This crate makes full use of some features of rust and can generate code with excellent performance.

### âœ¨ Very easy to port and has good extensibility âœ¨
If you want to port this crate, you only need to implement the `Mmap` trait for your platform. And you can use hook functions to implement additional functionality based on this crate.

### âœ¨ Tiny library with few dependencies âœ¨
With minimal features, this crate only depends on the `elf`, `cfg-if`, and `bitflags` crates.

# Usage
It implements the general steps for loading ELF files and leaves extension interfaces, allowing users to implement their own customized loaders.

# Feature

| Feature      |  Description  |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| fs        |  Enable support for filesystems      						|
| use-libc  |  Use libc as the backend, otherwise directly use linux syscalls		|
| mmap      |  Use the default implementation on platforms with mmap when loading ELF files| 
| version   |  Use the version information of symbols when resolving them.     |

# Example
## mini-loader
This repository provides an example of a [mini-loader](https://github.com/weizhiao/elf_loader/tree/main/mini-loader) implemented using `elf_loader`. The miniloader can load PIE files and currently only supports `x86_64` .

Load `ls`:

```shell
$ cargo build --release -p mini-loader --target=x86_64-unknown-none
$ ./mini-loader /bin/ls
``` 
It should be noted that mini-loader must be compiled with the release parameter.
## dlopen-rs
[dlopen-rs](https://crates.io/crates/dlopen-rs) is also implemented based on the `elf_loader` library. It implements the functionality of dlopen, allowing dynamic libraries to be opened at runtime.

# TODO
* Support more CPU instruction sets (currently only supports AArch64, Riscv64, X86-64).
* Improve support for DT_FLAGS flag bits.
* Improve comments and documentation.
* Add examples (e.g., an example of loading dynamic libraries using an asynchronous interface).
* Add support for more instruction sets in the example mini-loader.

...

# Supplement
If you encounter any issues during use, feel free to raise them on GitHub. We warmly welcome everyone to contribute code to help improve the functionality of `elf_loader`. ðŸ˜Š
